# Sass Installation Steps

1. I ensured that **Node.js** was already installed on my machine.

2. I created a **new directory** for my project using the terminal and navigated into it.

3. Inside the project directory, I ran the following command to install Sass:

   ```
   npm install sass@v3.7.4
   ```

4. I pressed **Enter**, and npm installed Sass in the project directory.
