        <h1>Why Semantic HTML and Accessibility Matter in Web Development</h1>
        <section>
          <p>As a front-end developer in training, I’ve come to realize that building websites isn’t just about how they look—it’s about how they work for everyone. That’s where semantic HTML and accessibility come in. Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags like header, article, and nav that help browsers, developers, and assistive technologies understand the structure and purpose of content. Accessibility ensures that people with disabilities—whether visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive—can navigate and interact with web content easily. Simple practices like using proper heading levels, adding alt text to images, labeling form elements, and ensuring good color contrast can make a huge difference. These principles not only improve usability and SEO but also reflect a developer’s commitment to inclusivity. As I build my blog project, I’m learning to write clean, purposeful code that makes the web a more welcoming place for everyone.</p>
