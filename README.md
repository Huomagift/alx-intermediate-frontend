# ðŸŒ€ Tailwind CSS Practice: Grid & Flex Layouts

The 0x02-tailwind-css directory contains a simple **practice project** where I explored **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox layouts with responsive design**, using **Tailwind CSS**.

## ðŸ“„ About

The page layout in this project demonstrates:

* Combining **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** effectively.
* Building a **responsive design** using Tailwindâ€™s utility classes.
* Practicing Tailwind breakpoints (`sm:`, `lg:`) to adapt layouts on different screen sizes.

The page includes:
* A header and footer.
* A main section with:
  * Flexbox for horizontally and vertically aligned sections.
  * A sidebar.
  * A responsive grid of images styled with Tailwind utilities.

## ðŸš€ Built With

* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) â€” included via CDN for quick prototyping.
* HTML5

Each directory is an independent practice exercise â€” this one focuses on layout with Tailwind CSS.

## ðŸ“· What I Practiced

âœ… Tailwind grid utilities:
`grid`, `grid-cols-1`, `lg:grid-cols-3`, `gap-4`

âœ… Tailwind flex utilities:
`flex`, `flex-col`, `flex-1`

âœ… Responsive design:
`sm:`, `lg:` prefixes to adjust layout at breakpoints
